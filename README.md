At this stage of the interview process, we would like to get a taste of your programming skills in
action.\
The task is very straightforward and shouldn’t
take more than half an hour.\
If you don’t finish everything in time, don’t worry;
we understand that programming in stressful
situations is hard, and we don’t like to work
under pressure either; we just want to see how
you work.\
The task is as follows:\
Use the CatAPI to fetch 50 images and display
them in a grid on the page.\
Please use the following resources for this task:\
● CatAPI: https://thecatapi.com/\
● This empty boilerplate project\
The image on the right is just an example; your solution doesn’t need to look exactly alike.\
If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask.\
Good luck!
